/* Exponential Moving Average.
 *
 * Each value in the series has an exponentially decreasing weight,
 * the older they get the less weight they have.
 *
 * The smoothing factor 'alpha' must be within 0 < alpha < 1.
 * The closer this factor to zero, the more equal the weight between
 * recent and older values. As it approaches one, the more recent values
 * will have more weight.
 *
 * The EMA can be thought of as an estimator for the next value when measures
 * are dependent. In this case, it can make sense to consider the mean square
 * error of the prediction. An 'alpha' minimizing this error would be the
 * better choice to improve the estimation.
 *
 * A common way to choose 'alpha' is to use the following formula:
 *
 *   a = 2 / (N + 1)
 *
 * With this 'alpha', the EMA will have the same 'center of mass' as an
 * equivalent N-values Simple Moving Average.
 *
 * When using this factor, the N last values of the EMA will have a sum weight
 * converging toward 0.8647, meaning that those values will account for 86% of
 * the average[1].
